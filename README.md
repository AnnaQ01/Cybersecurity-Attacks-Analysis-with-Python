# Cybersecurity-Attacks-Analysis-with-Python
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing cybersecurity attack patterns and trends using Python to explore attack trends, detect anomalies, and derive data-driven insights for improving cybersecurity defenses.
Libraries Used:pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
Project Scope:
- Data Processing: Load and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, standardize formats), extract relevant time-based features (Year, Month, Week, Day), and encode categorical variables for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze cybersecurity attack trends across different aspects (e.g., attack type, network segment, traffic type, browser) and identify attack trendlines.
- Data Visualization: Represent results through various charts and trendline graphs, identifying attack frequency patterns across different timeframes (monthly, yearly, weekly) for deeper insights.
## About dataset
This dataset provides a comprehensive record of network traffic data related to various cybersecurity threats and attacks. It includes attributes such as attack types, network protocols, IP addresses, severity levels, and security alerts. The dataset is valuable for cybersecurity researchers, network administrators, and data scientists analyzing network security incidents, intrusion detection, and malware detection.
The dataset consists of 25 varied metrics and 40,000 records:

- Timestamp: The exact date and time when the network event was recorded.
- Source IP Address: The IP address of the device that initiated the connection.
- Destination IP Address: The IP address of the target machine receiving the connection.
- Source Port: The originating port from which the traffic was sent.
- Destination Port: The receiving port where the traffic is directed.
- Protocol: The network protocol used for communication (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).
- Packet Length: The size of the network packet in bytes.
- Packet Type: The type of packet being transmitted.
- Traffic Type:Classification of the type of network traffic 
- Payload Data: Contents of the network packet payload.
- Malware Indicators: Binary or categorical indicators specifying whether the traffic contains known malware signatures.
- Anomaly Scores: A numerical score indicating the deviation of traffic from normal patterns, which helps in identifying potential security threats.
- Alerts/Warnings: Security alerts or warnings generated based on network activity.
- Attack Type: The classification of the cybersecurity attack
- Attack Signature: Unique identifiers or signatures associated with specific attack types.
- Action Taken: The response action taken against a detected attack
- Severity Level: The impact level of the attack, categorized as Low, Medium, or High based on its threat potential.
- User Information: Details about the user involved in the network activity
- Device Information: Information about the device generating or receiving the network traffic.
- Network Segment: The specific network segment or subnet where the event occurred.
- Geo-location Data: Geographic information related to the source or destination IP address.
- Proxy Information: Details about any proxy servers involved in the connection.
- Firewall Logs: Firewall events and rules triggered during the connection.
- IDS/IPS Alerts: Alerts generated by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems when suspicious or malicious activity is detected.
- Log Source: The origin of the log entry

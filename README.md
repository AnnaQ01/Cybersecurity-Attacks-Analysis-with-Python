# Analysing data: 
- Overall, the number of cybersecurity attacks remained consistently high from 2020 to 2022, all surpassing 10,000 attacks per year. In 2023, the total number of attacks dropped to 8139, a significant decrease compared to previous years.
- For the monthly trend, March (3,678), May (3,595), June (3,609), July (3,623), and August (3,615) recorded the highest number of cybersecurity attacks. Meanwhile, November (2,703) and December (2,675) have the lowest attack counts, suggesting a slowdown in attack activity. => Organizations should increase security audits and system patching before these high-risk months and strengthen cybersecurity measures during these months.

- Anomaly scores are used to quantify the likelihood that an event is unusual or suspicious compared to normal behavior. There is no clear correlation between anomaly scores and attacks becacause some months, such as March and November, show high anomaly scores but fewer attacks. Both anomaly scores and attacks peaked in March, possibly indicating a high-threat period with more detected incidents.

- Cybersecurity Attacks by attack types: Overall, The number of attacks for DDoS, Malware, and Intrusion are nearly equal, each exceeding 13,000 occurrences, indicating that all three attack types pose a significant cybersecurity threat. The number of DDoS, Intrusion, and Malware attacks remained relatively stable from 2020 to 2022, fluctuating around 3,500 to 3,600 attacks per year, with a slight increase in 2022. However, they all dropped sharply in 2023

- Monthly Trend of Cybersecurity Attacks by Type: March, May, June, and July show higher attack volumes across all attack types. From September onwards, all attack types show a sharp decline. In details, The DDoS attack type saw a sharp increase in March, while Intrusion attacks were recorded the highest number in June. In addition, Malware attacks remain relatively steady, they follow a slight increase mid-year before declining in the last quarter. Therefore, Organiztions should strengthen defenses during peak months (March, May, June, July), especially focus on monitoring and blocking DDoS attacks in March and Intrusion attacks in mid-year.

- Total attacks by browsers: The number of cybersecurity attacks targeting Mozilla is significantly higher than Opera. This suggests higher user adoption or more vulnerabilities in Mozilla that attackers exploit. The number of cybersecurity attacks remained relatively stable from 2020 to 2022, with only minor fluctuations. However, in 2023, there was a sharp decline in attacks, suggesting improved security measures, lower user activity, or changes in attacker behavior.

- Monthly trend of cybersecurity attacks by Traffic type: The number of attacks across DNS, FTP, and HTTP traffic types increased significantly in March, May, June, and August. March saw the sharpest rise, particularly in FTP traffic, suggesting that attackers were more active using this protocol. FTP traffic had the highest attack spike in March, while HTTP attacks peaked in June. DNS traffic maintained a steadier trend but dropped significantly towards the year-end. Therefore, Organizations should trengthen Security in Peak Months, like in March, May, June, and August to mitigate attack risks; and should monitor FTP Traffic and apply additional intrusion detection.

- Monthly attack by severity level: March, June, and July have the highest number of attacks across all severity levels. March shows the sharpest peak in high-severity attacks. April to September maintains relatively stable attack levels across all severity categories. Meanwhile, Medium-severity attacks have a steady increase, peaking in August. Attacks drop drastically from Quater 4. Therefore, Organizations should ncrease threat monitoring in Q2 and Q3, especially for high-severity attacks. Especially, focus on March and August trends, as they consistently show spikes across different severity levels.

# Conclusions: 
- There is no clear correlation between anomaly scores and the number of attacks.
- Throughout the year, March, May, June, July, and August recorded the highest number of attacks while November and December had the fewest attacks. Therefore, Organizations should implement proactive security audits, patch vulnerabilities, and reinforce cybersecurity defenses before high-risk months. Especially, Focus on DDoS attacks in March and and Intrusion attacks in mid-year. 
- For weekly activities, DDoS attacks peak on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Malware attacks increase on Mondays and Fridays, Intrusion attacks remain stable but slightly increase over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). Therefore, Organizations should implement advanced DDoS protection early in the week and increase intrusion monitoring on weekends.
- By Network Protocols, Organizations should implement advanced IDS/IPS systems and firewall rules to better filter malicious traffic because the ICMP attacks were higher.
- Mobile devices (Android, iPhone, iPad, iPod) experience fewer attacks. Therefore, prioritize Windows security protections while enhancing endpoint security for Linux and macOS. For browser, Strengthen Mozilla browser security, focusing on March-August.
- Strengthen FTP security in March, HTTP security in June, and apply intrusion detection on DNS traffic.
